    "To show the first characterization, let $C\\subseteq V$ be the set of vertices reachable from $s$ in $(V,U_f)$. By definition of $C$, all arcs in $\\delta^+_{G_f}(C)$ have residual capacity $0$. This implies that in particular, for every edge $a\\in\\delta_G^+(C)$, the residual capacity on $a$ must be zero, hence $f(a)=u(a)$, and thus $f(\\delta^+_G(C))=u(\\delta^+_G(C))$. Moreover, for every edge $a\\in\\delta_G^-(C)$, the flow on $a$ must be zero, i.e., $f(a)=0$, and thus $f(\\delta^-_G(C))=0$. Consequently,\n",

    "hence by the weak max-flow min-cut theorem, $C$ is a minimum cut. Now assume for contradiction that there is an (inclusion-wise) strictly smaller minimum $s$-$t$ cut $C_0\\subsetneq C$. Thus, there exists a vertex $v\\in C\\setminus C_0$, and by construction of $C$, there is an $s$-$v$ path in $(V,U_f)$. As $C_0$ is a minimum cut, we must have \n",

But this implies that for any edge $b\\in \\delta^+_{G_f}(C_0)$, we have $u_f(b)=0$.
