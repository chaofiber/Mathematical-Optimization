    "Imagine that you are the director of a big zoo. Every day, several groups come to visit, and these groups can enjoy a special offer: They can participate in events organized for them, as for example animal feedings, guided tours behind the scenes, film screenings, etc. So far, there was one event offered every full hour from 8:00 in the morning until 18:00 in the evening, and groups could freely choose where to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the events incurs fixed positive costs that are independent of the actual number of participating groups. Moreover, you know in advance at what time groups plan to come to your zoo and leave again, i.e., you know for each group in which consecutive events they could potentially participate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an effort to save costs, your goal is to only offer a subset of the current events based on a daily decision that you make after knowing the groups' schedules.

But note that the total cost will then be $17$, which is more than if you decide to offer the events at 10:00, 13:00, and 15:00 (the latter set has total cost $15$, and it is easy to see that every group can participate in at least one of the chosen events).\n",

If you use an LP solving package, it is often not clear what methods are used in the background.

There are various ways to find optimal vertex solutions, two of them are the following:\n",

Moving in a non-zero direction inside the subspace until we hit new constraints, we can iteratively increase the number of tight constraints until a full-rank system and hence a vertex solution is reached."
