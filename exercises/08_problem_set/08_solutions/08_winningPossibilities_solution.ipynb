    "<font color=\"blue\"><b>First task:</b></font> Max's argument is not complete - just arguing that a team has enough remaining games to catch up with the *current* score of the leading team is not enough. Max checked that the two leading teams do not play each other, but this is not enough: Imagine that in the remaining season, the first three teams will all play each other once, then at least one of them will have 42 points! Thus, we conclude that a final decision cannot be made from seeing the current table only, there is a dependence on the remaining games that are to be played."
