    "## Solution: Maximizing flow in a network\n",
    "\n",
    "We generalize the problem in the following way: Given a directed graph $G=(V,A)$ with to special distinct vertices $s,t\\in V$ (think of $s$ as the source and $t$ as the target) and arc capacities $u\\colon A\\to \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$, we want to find a flow value $f_a\\geqslant 0$ for each $a\\in A$ such that the following two conditions hold:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **(Capacity constraints)** For no arc $a\\in A$, the flow $f_a$ is larger than its capacity $u_a$.\n",
    "- **(Conservation constraints)** For every vertex $v\\in V\\setminus\\{s,t\\}$, the total amount of flow on incoming arcs equals the total amount of flow on outgoing arcs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such flows are called $s$-$t$ flows. Moreover, among all flows satisfying these conditions, we want to find one maximizing the net outflow at $s$, i.e., the value of all flows on outgoing arcs at $s$ minus the value of all flows on incoming arcs at $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to see that the above generalizes the given setting: Choosing the countries as vertices, i.e.,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V=\\{F,G,C,S,A\\},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the roads as arcs, i.e.,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A=\\{(S,F),(G,A),(C,A),(F,G),(F,C),(G,C)\\},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "the graph $G=(V,A)$ describes the given road network. Setting $s=S$ and $t=A$ corresponds to our wish to send flow from Spain to Austria.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Coming up with an LP\n",
    "\n",
    "To write a linear program that finds an $s$-$t$ flow in $G$ of maximum value, we introduce variables $f_a\\in\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq0}$ for all $a\\in A$. It is then easy to formulate capacity and conservation constraints as linear constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Capacity constraints: $$f_a\\leq u_a \\quad \\text{for all } a\\in A.$$\n",
    "- Conservation constraints: $$\\sum_{a\\in \\delta^-(v)} f_a = \\sum_{a\\in \\delta^+(v)} f_a \\quad\\text{for all } v\\in V\\setminus\\{s,t\\}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $\\delta^-(v)$ and $\\delta^+(v)$ denote all incoming and outgoing arcs at vertex $v$, respectively. Using this notation, we can also write the value of a flow $f$ as a linear function: It is precisely the net outflow at $s$, which is $$\\sum_{a\\in \\delta^+(s)} f_a - \\sum_{a\\in \\delta^-(s)} f_a.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, a linear program that solves the maximum $s$-$t$ flow problem is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{rrcll}\n",
    "\\max & \\sum_{a\\in \\delta^+(s)} f_a - \\sum_{a\\in \\delta^-(s)} f_a \\\\\n",
    "     & f_a & \\leq & u_a & \\forall a\\in A \\\\\n",
    "     & \\sum_{a\\in \\delta^+(v)} f_a - \\sum_{a\\in \\delta^-(v)} f_a & = & 0 & \\forall v\\in V\\setminus\\{s,t\\} \\\\\n",
    "     & f_a & \\geq & 0 & \\forall a\\in A.\n",
