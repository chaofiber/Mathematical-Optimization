If there are solutions, we will find one using the IP, and to see if there exist more solutions, we can do a trick exploiting the objective function of our IP, which we currently did not use: Consider the support $S$ of a fixed solution of the IP. Any other solution will have a different support, i.e., the number of variables in $S$ that are set to one will be strictly less than $|S|$. Thus, putting the sum of all variables in $S$ as an objective and minimizing over all solutions will give a different solution if there exists one.\n",

The latter allows, for example, to check whether an input sudoku has a solution with a number different from $5$ in the top left cell by using `objective = [5, 0, 0, ..., 0]`.\n",
